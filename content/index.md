# Rebar Wiki

Structural memory for Claude Code and any MCP-compatible editor. Framework repo: [github.com/spotcircuit/rebar](https://github.com/spotcircuit/rebar). Landing page: [getrebar.dev](https://getrebar.dev).

Start with **[Getting Started](getting-started)** if you're new. The rest of this wiki is organized by topic.

## 🔧 How it works

Framework mechanics — the self-learn loop, knowledge layers, and command surface.

- [[how-it-works/commands|Commands]] — all 26 slash commands across client/app management, development, wiki, and the self-learning harness
- [[how-it-works/self-learn-loop|Self-Learn Loop]] — how observations get validated, promoted, or discarded
- [[how-it-works/three-systems|Four Knowledge Systems]] — expertise.yaml + memory + skills + wiki (why they stay separate)
- [[how-it-works/paperclip-integration|Paperclip Integration]] — autonomous agent orchestration layer

## 📊 Diagrams

Visual overviews of the framework.

- [[diagrams/architecture|Architecture]] — system overview, close-loop harness, four knowledge systems, agent orchestration (6 mermaid diagrams)
- [[diagrams/command-flow|Command Flow]] — how commands chain together through the development cycle (5 mermaid diagrams)

## Using this wiki

- **Left sidebar** — browse by folder. Files are grouped into the buckets above.
- **Search** (top-left) — full-text search across everything.
- **Graph** (right, desktop) — see how pages cross-link.
- **Backlinks** (right, desktop) — who links TO the page you're on.

## Contributing

The wiki is sourced from `wiki/` in the [rebar repo](https://github.com/spotcircuit/rebar). Edit a `.md` file there and push via `bash scripts/publish-wiki.sh` from the rebar repo — the Quartz site auto-rebuilds on the next push. Add a new page by creating it under the appropriate folder with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
tags: [pattern, example]
---
```

Cross-link liberally with `[[double-bracket-syntax]]` — that's the Obsidian / Quartz convention.
