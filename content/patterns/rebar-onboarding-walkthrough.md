# Rebar Onboarding Walkthrough

#patterns #rebar #onboarding

Standard walkthrough for onboarding a new team member to the Rebar framework. Covers the four knowledge systems, day-to-day commands, the self-learn loop, and the close-loop harness.

## Key Points for New Engineers

1. **Start with client.yaml** — copy from `clients/_templates/client.yaml`, fill in, run `/discover`
2. **Phase 0** — auto-generated tech stack analysis, architecture assessment, potential gotchas
3. **Day-to-day** — `/brief` for standups, `/check` for compliance, `/improve` after investigations
4. **After a feature ships** — run `/close-loop <feature>` to trigger the four-gate harness (evaluator → release gate → /improve --from → /meta-improve queue → /wiki-ingest)
5. **Wiki intake** — drop files in `raw/`, run `/wiki-ingest`
6. **Compounding loop** — good answers from questions get filed via `/wiki-file <topic>`
7. **Template changes** — `/meta-improve` queues patches; run `/meta-apply` in main session to review
8. **Maintenance** — `/wiki-lint` periodically for orphans, broken links, stale pages

## Why Not Just a Wiki?

Four systems exist because of different access patterns:
- **YAML** — machine-readable, parsed programmatically by commands
- **Memory** — injected silently into every session, behavioral rules
- **Skills** — tactical playbooks auto-discovered by Claude Code's skill router
- **Wiki** — cross-linked, human-readable, cross-project

Mixing them creates something hard to query and hard to maintain.

## The "Aha" Moment

"The LLM reads index.md first to navigate, follows the wiki links, and synthesizes answers with full context. No searching, no stale docs that nobody updates. The system maintains itself as a side effect of doing work."
